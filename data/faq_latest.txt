Wages for hawker assistants.

## Protection Against Scams

### How do I avoid falling prey to phishing scams?

It is important to stay vigilant and take necessary precaution to avoid falling prey to phishing scams. Here are some tips on how to protect yourself against phishing scams impersonating NEA:
Do not share your Singpass ID / password or banking details with anyone.
Stay vigilant and only click on links from trusted source. Always log in to FormSG from the official NEA website at https://www.nea.gov.sg/

All official emails from NEA will be sent from addresses ending with “@nea.gov.sg”
NEA officers will not make phone calls to you with a prefix "+65". If you receive a call with a prefix that includes a plus (+) sign, it is likely to be an overseas call. Be cautious when receiving such calls and verify the identity of the caller before sharing any personal information.

### How do I check if the call or email is from NEA?

We may contact tenderers via voice call or email using email addresses ending with “@nea.gov.sg”. We will not ask for bank transfers, personal details, bank account and credit card details, Singpass details or One-Time Passwords (OTPs) over the phone or email.
Please check what you have received is from NEA before you provide any information. To check, you can contact our NEA Contact Centre at 6225 5632 or write to us via NEA Online Feedback Form (www.nea.gov.sg/feedback).
